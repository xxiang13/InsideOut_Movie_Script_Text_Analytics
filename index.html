                    <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%">This project involves analyzing dialogue text. Dialogue text is pervasive in our daily lives, showing up in forums, chat, or phone. Text data can be very rich, but the unstructured nature can be challenging. In this project we apply various text analytics techniques to gain insight on the movie script of Disney's Inside Out. Can we detect character's emtions through text? This page presents highlights of our findings.

                    <strong><p>The exploratory results showed the top characters, locations and scenes by simply counting the number of utterances (quotes).

                            <p>Because the character names are emotions (Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust), they were replaced by common names (Joyce, Felipe, Angelo and Diane) for the text analysis to avoid issues with the parsing and name entity recognition, and biases with the sentiment analysis (e.g. Sadness mentions Joy most of the time).</p>
                            <p>The unigram word cloud from quotes and descriptions of the script provides basic messages about characters, locations and events. For example, Riley, Joyce are the two main characters and followed by Sadness and Bing Bong.</p>

						<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2>
					</header>
                    <strong><p align="center">The sentiment analysis of each character matched the personality definition they represent. For example, Joy has one of the most positive mood while Disgust the most negative mood. In addition, the sentiment corresponds to turning points in the movie. For instance, when Riley moves to San Francisco there is a drop in the positive sentiment, which drops further to scenes where there is drama and struggles (e.g. dinner argument and trying to escape from long-term memory). The sentiment becomes more positive in the hockey rink due to cheering and end of the movie when Joy is back.</p></strong>

                            <p>We visualized the sentiment result by nine main characters. On the right we can see the average binary sentiment and average count sentiment. The results of the two different methods are similar: same orders of characters by an average of sentiment. Mon and Joy are the top two positive characters and Sadness and Disgust are only negative characters of these main characters. Count sentiment gives more weights on sentiment scores (counts of positive, negative words), so it has a larger range of average of sentiment compared to binary sentiment. Therefore, we selected count sentiment method for further sentiment visualizations.</p>

                            <p>In the movie, Joy and Sadness were always together. It is interesting to compare the sentiment scores between them. In the figure below, Joy has more positive scores than negative ones; in contrast, Sadness has more negative scores than positive ones. The result matches the definition of personalty for these two characters.</p>

                            <p>The image below shows the average of sentiment scores by each scene. The average sentiment scores dropped from ‘Riley is Born’ to ‘Moving to San Francisco’. Joy and Sadness fell into Long-term Memory and Riley’s emotions were not controlled by Joy, and the sentiment score sharply dropped to negative level until they met Bing Bong. Scene ‘Hockey Tryouts’ hits the highest sentiment scores since there were a lot of encouragements.

							<p>Clustering based on the tfidf matrix and using k-means with different cluster size for characters, locations and scenes was conducted. The results show that the main characters are assigned to separate clusters, while the rest of characters are usually assigned to one cluster.
                            <p>However, due to the small size of the dataset (e.g. few characters, locations and scenes), hierarchical clustering was performed as it is more appropriate for small datasets. The algorithm merges or splits clusters recursively based on the linkage criteria (based on cosine distance in this case). In this case, ward, average and complete linkages were tested. The results show that ward distances seem to perform better than the other linkages.
                            </p>
							<p>The figure on the right shows the dendrogram using ward linkage for characters. It can be seen that at a high level, 3 clusters are formed: the main characters (e.g. Riley, Mom, Dad, Bing Bong and the emotions), Mom’s emotions, and the rest of the characters. At the lower level, we can see that Mom and Dad are grouped together, which are then grouped together with Riley. Similar insights can be gained from the emotions and the rest of the characters, indicating that the clustering overall makes sense. </p>
